EPIC 

A simple menu that allows the user to order a custom burger. 

Build Your Own Burger 
	- As a user, I want to create my own burger by choosing the ingredients and then see the 	total cost of my order
		  - design a menu that displays a checkbox list of burger ingredient options for 			the user to choose from, separated         into categories. Categories include: 
			    - Bun 
		    	- Meat 
			    - Toppings 
			    - Sauce 
	   	- create a function that allows the user to check only one item for each category and a maximum of three items for             the ‘toppings’ category (UNASSISTED)
		  - create a function that will display a summary of the order (in its categories) once the ‘Proceed’ button has been           selected. (ASSISTED) Eg:
			    ORDER
			    Bun: Sesame Seed
			    Meat: Chicken
			    Toppings: Bacon, Avocado
